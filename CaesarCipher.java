        The key insight is that regular Strings in Java are immutable — once created, they can never be changed. So if you wrote result = result + shifted inside the loop, Java would silently throw away the old string and create a brand new one on every single iteration. For a short message that's fine, but for anything long it wastes a lot of memory.

        StringBuilder solves this by giving you a single mutable object that just grows as you call .append() on it. You build up the whole encrypted message inside it, and only at the very end does .toString() convert it into a regular String to return.
